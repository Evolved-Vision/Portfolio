            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Levaughn Bolden. Aspiring Ethical Hacker and Lifelong Learner. I'm passionate about securing networks, identifying vulnerabilities, and building resilient systems. After serving in the Navy, I discovered my love for technology and have been dedicated to learning everything I can about cybersecurity.

Current Focus: -Gaining hands-on experience in penetration testing and vulnerability analysis. -Building a strong foundation in networking, Python programming, and cryptography.

Lifelong Goals: -Become a top Ethical Hacker in the industry. -Inspire others transitioning into tech to pursue their passions.</p>

                <h3>Network Vulnerability Assessment Using Wireshark & Nmap</h3>
                <p>Explored network vulnerabilities by scanning hosts using Nmap and analyzing traffic with Wireshark, identifying risks such as open ports, brute-force attacks, and unencrypted transmissions.</p>
                <h3>Tools and Techniques:</h3>
                <p>NMAP: Used for network discovery, topology mapping, and vulnerability identification.</p>
                <p>Wireshark: Captured and analyszed traffic, uncovering unauthorized access attempts and potential DoS attacks.</p>
                <p>Security Hardening Recommendations: Applied best practices from NIST, OWASP, and industry standards.</p>
                <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
                <p>FTP Anonymous Login Vulnerability – Allowed unauthorized access to sensitive files.
                <br>Port 80 Unencrypted Traffic – Exposed credentials to interception attacks.
                <br>Brute Force & DoS Indicators – Repeated failed login attempts and repetitive HTTP requests suggested ongoing attacks.</p>
                <h3>Mitigation Strategies:</h3>
                <p>Enforced HTTPS (Port 443) and blocked Port 80.
                <br>Implemented login throttling and MFA to prevent brute-force attacks.
                <br>Applied rate limiting and firewall rules to mitigate DoS threats.</p>
                <h3>Evidence & Screenshots:</h3>

                <p>I completed the nmap 10.168.27.0/24 command to complete an initial network discovery. </p>
                <p>Afterward, to identify the topology I completed nmap –traceroute 10.168.27.0/24 to get an idea of the path of traffic on the network. </p>
                <P>After reviewing the output all host that are up on the network only have 1 hop to the gateway which indicates a star topology.</p>

                <p>After reviewing the output for Nmap it appears that there are two host that has several ports open to unknown services. 
                <br>These could represent security risk within the network. Further investigation would be needed to gather additional information 
                <br>regarding the legitimacy of the services running on the open ports. The screenshot shows that there is an ftp anonymous log in, 
                <br>which could allow unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server. There is a risk of data theft, unauthorized modification,
                <br>or exploitation of the server. Additionally, port 80 is open, which is an unencrypted port. This can mean that traffic transmitted over 
                <br>this port such as log in credentials and or other sensitive data, could be intercepted by attacks such as man in the middle attacks or 
                <br>modification of transmitted data.</p>

                <P>Furthermore, the http responses for the status code “200 ok” all have the same byte length of 1950 bytes. 
                 <br>This appears to be a request of the same resource over and over which could also indicate a DOS attack. 
                 <br>This constant request of the same resource could also imply that a bot is being used to make these repetitive
                 <br>request in order to overload the system.  </P>
